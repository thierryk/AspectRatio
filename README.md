# Aspect Ratio Via CSS (WIP)
Modules for applying a desired aspect ratio to html elements (via CSS)

The only difference between the 2 modules below is the type of **hook** they use:

   * **[aspect-ratio-via-attribute-selector](https://github.com/thierryk/aspect-ratio-via-css/tree/master/aspect-ratio-via-attribute-selector)** relies solely on `attribute` selector
   * **[aspect-ratio-via-class-selector](https://github.com/thierryk/aspect-ratio-via-css/tree/master/aspect-ratio-via-class-selector)** relies on a `class` selector

**IMPORTANT**: If you are concerned with performance, Iâ€™d suggest you to choose the latter.
